# Jewellery-management-System
The proposed project on Jewellery Shop Management is an online application designed to deal with the sales and purchasing process in a Jewellery Shop. It enhances the process of recording details and online order of the jewels. The installation and implementation of the project roots out the possibility of occurrence of errors during transaction process.  This project provides an effective managing platform to any Jewellery Shop for providing fast, reliable and comfortable service to the customers. After the implementation of this project, the manager can keep records regarding monthly and yearly sales and billing details.
